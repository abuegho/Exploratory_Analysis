3. Submit a link to this document

Your Capstone project milestone report is an early draft of your final Capstone report. We encourage you and your mentor to plan multiple milestones if possible, since your story will evolve with exploration and analysis. This is a slightly longer (3-5 page) draft that should have the following:

* An introduction to the problem (based on your earlier Capstone submissions).

* A deeper dive into the data set:

* What important fields and information does the data set have?

* What are its limitations i.e. what are some questions that you cannot answer with this data set?

* What kind of cleaning and wrangling did you need to do?

* Any preliminary exploration youâ€™ve performed and your initial findings.

* Based on these findings, what approach are you going to take? How has your approach changed from what you initially proposed, if applicable?

Basically, the milestone is an opportunity for you to practice your data story skills. We encourage you and your mentor to plan multiple milestones if possible.
